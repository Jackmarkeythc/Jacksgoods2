              National Style 0 Model Resophonic Guitar (1937), made in Los Angeles, serial # A-5570, nickel plated finish, brass body, poplar neck with ebonized fingerboard, black hard shell case.
              This guitar is oozing Delta blues mojo! It's reminiscent of the same Style O that Keith Richards used onstage during the Rolling Stones 1969 US Tour. This guitar has some miles, but it has so many more miles to go. It was played and played well. 
              The heavy playing has left it missing its original pickguard and original fretboard binding. However, it was played smooth to where the missing binding has no "edge" except in areas where your hand will never touch during play. 
              I barely even noticed the binding was gone until I remember it was standard on Style O Nationals. I have an old vintage National Triolain that is a basketcase, and I use it for parts. 
              I took 6 frets from the Triolian and replaced the lowest 6 frets on this fretboard because they'd been played hard and needed to be replaced. 
              If I hadn't told you, you'd never notice, but for the deep fretboard impressions.

              Fender Custom Shop (FCS) Limited Edition Terry Kath Telecaster® Masterbuilt by Dennis Galuszka
              Terry Kath has been praised by fans and guitar greats alike for his brilliance as an absolute guitar powerhouse. Kath, who Jimi Hendrix once cited as his favorite guitarist, fused sophisticated songwriting ability with his soulful vocals to launch Chicago Transit Authority in 1967. 
              The band shortened its name to Chicago in 1969, achieving worldwide success and 2016 induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. A consummate innovator, Kath created mind-blowing, never-before-heard guitar tones by experimenting with unorthodox guitar/amp configurations. 
              His instinctive command of his completely original tone is heard on memorable tracks such as "25 or 6 to 4", "Free Form Guitar", "Introduction" and others.

                  Orianthi is known for working with top musicians, including Carlos Santana, Alice Cooper, Carrie Underwood, and Michael Jackson, and PRS guitars have been in her hands every step of the way. This limited edition is based on the in-demand guitarist's personalized Custom 24 first made as a one-off artist build by the Private Stock team in 2017.
                  The Private Stock Orianthi Limited Edition keeps many of the specs as the original artist build, including a figured maple top, mahogany back, and a 24-fret, 25" scale length, Pattern Thin mahogany neck with rosewood fretboard.
                  Like the original, the fretboard is adorned with a custom "Lotus Vine" inlay (similar to PRS's classic "Tree of Life" design) that was inspired by a pen Orianthi sent to the team. The inlay is made from pink mussel and mother of pearl. 
                  Newly developed to showcase the Private Stock grade figured maple, the Private Stock Orianthi Limited Edition comes in Blooming Lotus Glow, which has a pink center glow that fades outward to a similar purple as the original artist build, which was opaque rather than hand stained.

                  Gibson Custom Shop is the pinnacle of craftsmanship, quality, and sound excellence. Each instrument celebrates Gibson's legacy through accuracy, authenticity and attention to detail.
                  1960 was the last year for the original Les Paul™ Standard, nearly identical to a 1959 model except for a few specs. Most notably, it features a fast-playing slim neck profile, beloved by the many famous musicians who played '60 Bursts including Eric Clapton, Joe Walsh, and Paul McCartney. 
                  It also has "reflector" Volume & Tone knobs and wider "double-ring" tuner tips. The Custom Shop 1960 Les Paul Standard Reissue is a clone of the originals from the hide-glue construction to the chemically re-engineered plastic parts. Each one is built with extreme care, reverence and attention to detail by expert Custom Shop craftspeople who are committed to providing an authentic vintage ownership experience. 
                  It also features Heavy Aging by the skilled artisans of the Murphy Lab. The Murphy Lab Heavy Aged finish treatment, paired with heavily aged hardware, simulates decades of heavy play wear, giving it the unique character, vibe, and feel of an original example from the Gibson Golden Era.

             With tone as hot as the Sonoran sun and looks as worn-in as an old pair of boots, the allure of the Limited Edition Red Hot Strat will captivate any player, aficionado or collector, and have them begging for a glass of ice water. A two-piece hand-selected ash body with deep contours wears a super heavy relic lacquer finish, creating a one-of-a-kind work of art in each build. A tinted 2A flame maple neck with 2A flame maple fingerboard sports a fat, comfortable 1959 "D" profile, 9.5" fingerboard radius and 21 narrow tall (6105) frets.

                  vMetallica fans worldwide are familiar with Kirk Hammett's 1979 Flying V. It was Kirk's first Gibson and established his passion for Gibson guitars. Its purchase was inspired by famous Flying V players Kirk admired and because he was looking for a fuller sound. 
                  And what a sound! Kirk still plays the original guitar to this day, and used it on all the early Metallica albums, including Kill 'Em All, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, ... And Justice for All, and The Black Album, making it one of the most important heavy metal guitars of all time. 
                  Only 200 were hand-made by the expert luthiers of the Gibson Custom Shop in Nashville, Tennessee, artfully aged to match the original by the Murphy Lab. The included Certificate of Authenticity photo is signed by Kirk Hammett himself.
